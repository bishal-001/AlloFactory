## Actors (Jessie, jane and a Female Student)

    (Jessie sitting at an empty table)

Jane: (approaching Jessie) Mind if I join you for lunch, Jessie?

Jessie: (looking up, surprised) Oh, hey Jane! Sure, have a seat.

Jane: So, what's with the gloomy face? You look like a dead fish.

Jessie: (sighs) It's just... I've been thinking a lot lately, Jane. It's been a year since I moved here, and the job that once seemed exciting has become so... mundane.

Jane: (laughs) Mundane? You're starting to sound like my grandmother. What's really bothering you?

Jessie: (opens up) I don't know, Jane. I think I need a change, but I'm not sure where to start. The routine is just too much.

Jane: (laughs again) Jessie, what you need is a long and thick cock that can fuck all the stress out of your Ass.

Jessie: (blushing) Jane, keep it down! There are kids around. You cannot use such vile language.

Jane: (apologizing with a smile) Oops, my bad. But seriously, Jessie, a change in lifestyle might be just what you need. Moving to this dull town while leaving your friends and the ever lively city life is why you are feeling like this.

Jessie: (trying to refocus) Jane, I'm serious. I need help figuring out a different career path. And I love this beautiful town.

Jane: (teasing) Well, maybe what you really need is someone to help you figure out other things. You know, romantic things.

Jessie: (flustered) Jane, please! This is not the time or place for that conversation.

Jane: (playful) Alright, alright. But seriously, maybe you need to loosen up a bit. Life's too short to be acting like a workaholic child.

Jessie: (annoyed) I'm not a child, Jane. And I did have a boyfriend in college.

Jane: (intrigued) Oh, spill the details! What was he like?

Jessie: (describing) He was a nice guy, really smart, and had a promising career ahead.

Jane: (teasing) Sounds like a nerd.

Jessie: (defensive) He wasn't a nerd. We even shared a few short kisses.

Jane: (awe-struck) Wow, you went beyond holding hands? Impressive.

Jessie: (changing the topic) Whatever. What about your nerdy boyfriend? How far did you guys go?

Jane: (nonchalant) Well, my nerdy boyfriend "rammed" me four times a week.

Jessie: (shocked) What?!

Jane: (smirking) Got pregnant once, too. Had to abort before my family found out.

Jessie: (speechless) I... I don't know what to say.

    (suddenly a group of students' voices reached their table and caught Jessie's attention)

Jessie: (changing the topic) "What's up with those kids? It's unusual for them to have a discussion about anything"

Jane: (noticing students nearby) You don't know! There's a new social media app that's been the talk of the town for the past week. Almost everyone in town is using it. However, there's a catch â€“ the app only works within the town's boundaries. Once you leave, it stops working.

Jessie: (curious) Are you using it too?

Jane: (smiling) Yes, of course. You should give it a try.

Jessie: (arrogant) I being a city person refrain myself from using such small apps. It also sounds like the app doesn't even work properly as it stops at the town's boundaries.

Jane: (expressionless) Your mother uses this app though. 

Jane: (smiling) And she also accepted my friend request too.

Jessie: (shocked) W~wh~what?

(The bell rings.)

Jane: (standing up) Well, Jessie, it was fun chatting with you.

    (jane left)

Jessie: (sitting) Why mom.....

    (Jessie gathers her things, noticing a female student nearby staring, who overheard their conversation)

Jessie: (embaressed) Oh no!! She must have heared all our conversetion. I should quickly leave.

    ( Feeling uneasy, Jessie quickly exits.)
