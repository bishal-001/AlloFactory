# Home (Part 1)

## Actors (Jessie and mother)

Jessie: (tired, unlocking the door) Long day. Finally, home sweet home.

    (Jessie arrives home, rings the doorbell, but there's no response.)

Jessie: Maybe she's busy with work. I'll just use my spare key.

    (She uses her spare key to open the door.)

Jessie: (calling out) Mom? You home?

    (No response. Jessie notices a note on the side.)

Note: "I'm going to one of my friend's houses, be back within a few hours, and food is inside the refrigerator - Mother."

Jessie: (grumbling) Of course, she's off having fun.

Jessie: (grumbling) Mother was against moving to this town, and now... She's the one enjoying the most.

Jessie: (heading to the bathroom) A nice hot bath is what I need to feel better.

    (In the bathroom, Jessie reflects on the house and its cost.)

Jessie: (soaking in the tub) Ah, this is exactly what I needed.

Jessie: (soaking in the tub) I still remember when my mother and I first saw this house. It was exactly like our dream house.

Jessie: (soaking in the tub) And it was selling at a very low price. Too good of an opportunity to pass.

Jessie: (soaking in the tub) It did cost us a fortune, but we managed to buy this house.

Jessie: (soaking in the tub) Bills are a little expensive, though. A little extra money would help out a lot.

Jessie: (soaking in the tub) But it's well worth it.

    (Jessie got out of the bath and headed to the living room to watch television.)

Jessie: (after the bath, watching TV) The broker shared the history of this house and other important stuff with us at the time of purchase.

Jessie: (after the bath, watching TV) But somehow details about the previous owner were left out.

Jessie: (after the bath, watching TV) So after the paperwork, I did ask the broker about the previous owner.

    (Jessie asking the broker about the previous owners.)

Broker: (nervously) Prev...Previous owners....

Broker: (nervously) An elderly couple owned this house...

Broker: (nervously) One day, they went on a trek to the nearby forest with a group of other elderly people.

Broker: (nervously) But the group never returned...

Broker: (nervously) A search party was formed consisting of the town's police and some local people, but they were unable to find even a single person or the belongings... It looked like they disappeared into thin air.

Jessie: (after the bath, watching TV) Long story short, as the elderly couple didn't have any relatives and didn't leave any will. This house was lapsed by the government until we bought it.

Jessie: (after the bath, watching TV) I never heard of such an incident before; it sounded farfetched.... If something like this occurred, it definitely would have made the media...

Jessie: (noticing the broker's anxiety) Now that I think about it, the broker did look a little anxious...

    (Jessie noticed the clock.)

Jessie: (looking at the clock) Mom's been gone for ages.

Jessie: (looking at the clock) I'm feeling so hungry... But I don't want to have dinner without her....

Jessie: (grumpy) None of the TV programs are good either... So boring...

    (Jessie remembers the social media app Jane mentioned.)

Jessie: (hesitant) Might as well try that app out.

    (Jessie installs the app and starts the registration process.)

Jessie: (mumbling) Looks like the username and profile picture are mandatory...

Jessie: (mumbling) Gotta keep this on the down-low. Don't want anyone, especially Jane, finding out.

Jessie: (mumbling) Username: Biglove69

    (For the profile picture, Jessie covered the top part of her face with her palm.)

Jessie: (mumbling) Finally... registration completed...

    (Completing the registration, the doorbell rings. Jessie places her phone on the couch and answers the door.)

    (Camera focuses on the phone on the couch as Jessie opens the door.)

Jessie's Mother: (cheerful) Hey, sweetie! Sorry I took longer than expected.

    (Distant chatter from the app is heard as Jessie's mother continues talking.)


Jessie: (after dinner, comfortable on her bed) Finally, the registration process is complete.

    (She opens the new app, secretly excited.)

Jessie: (secretly excited) Time to explore.

    (As she scrolls through her newsfeed, she discovers various content types.)

Jessie: Short stories, long stories, voice captures, gifs, video shorts, livestreams, podcasts... Quite the variety.

Jessie: Should I check out some of my friend's profiles...

Jessie: Of course, why not...

Jessie: Before that let's make my profile's personal information private.

Jessie: Done...

    ( She notices an option called "HelpMate")

Jessie: Hmm... What is this "HelpMate" thing?

    (Click, Click)

Title: Rules to Follow

Each week, a list of jobs, including reward money, will be provided.

To fulfill a job, the HelpMate must capture a picture proof of them completing the job with the caption "#completed" and post it on the app. The post will undergo verification, and the HelpMate will receive the reward. 

If no picture proof is uploaded after the job has been fulfilled by the "HelpMate," the job is considered failed, and no reward will be received.

The "HelpMate" is allowed to post a picture of the job that they partially completed or failed to complete with only "#Failed" as a caption. The "HelpMate" will not receive the reward money but will be compensated in some other way.

If the captions are not added to the post, the "HelpMate" will not receive any compensation and will also be penalized instead.

(Important Note: The penalty will not be a monetary fine.)

    (After reading through the rules)

Jessie: This seems interesting.

Jessie: I could make some easy money from this. So this is why this app has been the talk of the town recently.

Jessie: It said the penalty will not be a monetary fine, a small ban maybe.

Jessie: A profitable oppurtunity, Let's try it out once.

    (Click, Click)

App: You will be notified when jobs are available.

Jessie: Hmm... figures...

    (The doorbell rings.)

Jessie: (startled) What was that?

Jessie: Did the doorbell just ring?

    (After a moment of silence)

Jessie: Must be my imagination.

    (The doorbell rings.)

    (She gets out of bed. The clock shows 12:03.)

Jessie: Who could it be at this hour?

Jessie: It's unusual; the whole town becomes as quiet as a graveyard after 9.

    (The doorbell rings again, and Jessie, feeling compelled to check, goes to the front door.)

Jessie: (nervously) It's not some kind of home invasion, right?

    (She opens it and is surprised to find no one.)

Jessie: (nervously) Hellooo...

Jessie: A note?

Note: Thank you and Welcome...

Jessie: Must be some sort of prank... I'm too tired for this...
