## Part 1 (At School cafeteria)

Jessie sat alone at a table in the school cafeteria, quietly having her lunch. On this particular day, her mood was a bit off. It had been a whole year since she arrived in the beautiful small town and started working as a teacher at the school. Initially, the experience was exciting—exploring a new town and diving into a fresh job. However, over time, the once-enjoyable job had transformed into nothing more than an unenjoyable, mundane routine. As she chewed her food, Jessie contemplated her desire for a change in her career. The monotony of her current situation weighed on her, and she longed for something new. Yet, she found herself at a loss, unsure of what direction to take or where to begin in seeking a new career change.

As she was lost in thought, a figure stood beside her and called out to her. Jessie startled and looked over her shoulder; it was her work friend, Jane. Jane had joined the school as a teacher at the same time as Jessie, and they had a few things in common that helped them communicate, making them fast friends. Jane asked if she could join Jessie for lunch, and Jessie readily agreed.

During their meal, Jane inquired about the reason behind Jessie's bad mood, and Jessie poured out everything on her mind. After hearing Jessie out, Jane started laughing. Jessie, a bit annoyed, expressed her discontent with Jane. Apologizing with a smile, Jane said that what Jessie needs is a thick long Cock that can ram all the stress out from her Ass. Jessie immediately became flustered and embarrassed, urging Jane to quiet down, as there were many children in the cafeteria, and Jane had used inappropriate words.

Jane, still in good spirits, reassured Jessie that everything was fine and that nobody heard a thing, as the cafeteria was louder than usual. Jessie, wanting to refocus on her predicament, asked Jane for help. However, Jane insisted that what Jessie truly needed was not a change in her career but a change in her lifestyle. Jane playfully advised Jessie not to act like an innocent child and suggested getting a boyfriend with whom she could enjoy some romantic time and perhaps a few stress-relieving sessions at bed. A flustered Jessie retorted that she was not an innocent child and mentioned having had a boyfriend back in college. She added that they even went as far as having short kisses. Jane, with a look of awe, asked Jessie about her boyfriend, to which Jessie replied that he was a nice guy, very good in studies, and had a promising career ahead. Jane teased, saying he sounded like a nerd, expressing wonder that they went beyond just holding hands. An irritated Jessie asked about Jane's nerd boyfriend and how far they went, to which Jane replied, "Well, my nerdy boyfriend ramms me two times a day". And Jane even got pregnant once but she had to abort before her family found out. Jessie couldn't say anything as she was in a state of shock. After a few moments, she wanted to change the topic when suddenly a group of students' voices reached their table and caught her attention. It seemed like the students were engaged in a heated discussion about something. Jessie wasted no time and shifted the topic to those students. She asked Jane, "What's up with those students? It's unusual for them to have a discussion about anything". Jane's attention was drawn to them, and she exclaimed, "You don't know! There's a new social media app that's been the talk of the town for the past week. Almost everyone in town is using it. However, there's a catch – the app only works within the town's boundaries. Once you leave, it stops working."

"Are you using it too?" Jessie inquired. Jane nodded and replied, "Yes, of course. You should give it a try." Jessie, considering herself a city person, dismissed it, stating that she doesn't use small apps like that. She also suggested that the app probably doesn't even function properly if it stops working outside of town.

In response, Jane pointed out that Jessie's mother uses the app, and they are friends on it. Jessie was taken aback and felt a bit embarrassed. (The bell rings) Jane stood up and said to Jessie that she should really start looking for a boyfriend to have some romance. Jessie stood up and told Jane to hurry or she would miss the next class. As Jessie gathered her things, her eyes landed on a table nearby where a female student was staring at her. It was apparent that the student had heard all of their conversation. Feeling a bit uneasy, Jessie quickly made her exit.

## Part 1 (At home)


After finishing her work at school, Jessie went straight home. She rang the doorbell, but no one answered, so she used her spare key to open the door and entered the house. Jessie called for her mother, but there was no response. Her eyes fell on a note at the side that read, "I'm going to one of my friend's houses, be back within a few hours, and food is inside the refrigerator - Mother." Jessie grumpily remarked that her mother was the one against moving to this town, and now she was the one having most of the fun, while Jessie was left with none.

Still in a grumpy mood, Jessie decided that what she needed was a nice hot bath and headed straight to the bathroom. While comfortably soaking in the bathtub, she reflected on the first time she and her mother saw this house. It matched their dream house, and despite being cheaper than comparable options in the city, it had pushed their budget. The house had cost them almost all the money they received from selling their old city house, but Jessie felt it was well worth it. However, the cost of maintenance posed a slight problem. Her salary covered their expenses, but a little more money would be greatly appreciated.

After finishing her bath and passing some time watching television, Jessie reminisced about the time when the paperwork was done and Jessica decided to ask the broker about the previous owner. Although the broker had shared the house's history, details about the previous owners were missing. The broker explained that they were an elderly couple who went missing during a trek in a nearby hilly forest. Despite police and local search party involvement, they were never found, and their son, living overseas, didn't even bothrerd to come and sold the house to the town. Reflecting on this, Jessie noted that the broker seemed anxious when asked about the previous owners, perhaps just her imagination.

Glancing at the clock, Jessie realized it had been over an hour, and her mother still hadn't returned. Television wasn't enough to alleviate her boredom, and she remembered the social media app Jane had told her about. She didn't want to at first but what could go wrong. Deciding to give it a try, she installed the app, and started the registration process, using the alias "___" for a username and covering the top part of her face for the profile picture. Since many at school used the app, she didn't want anyone, especially Jane, to know she was using it. As she completed the registration, the doorbell rang. Jessie placed her phone on the couch and went to open the door—her mother had returned, (with a distant chat heard as the camera focused on the phone on the couch).


## Part 2 (At Bedroom)


After dinner, Jessie got comfortable on her bed in her bedroom, knowing that the registration process was complete. She opened the new app. Although she didn't show it, she was secretly excited to try the app out. The app turned out to be exactly like a run-of-the-mill social media platform. As Jessie scrolled through her newsfeed, she found a variety of content: short stories, long stories, voice captures, gifs, video shorts, livestreams, podcasts, etc.

Before delving deeper into the app and checking out a few profiles, Jessie went to the settings to make her personal information private. She noticed an option called "HelpMate" and clicked on it. A dialog box appeared with the following text:

Title: Rules to Follow

1. Each week, a list of jobs, including reward money, will be provided.

2. To fulfill a job, the HelpMate must capture a picture proof of them completing the job with the caption "#completed" and post it on the app. The post will undergo verification, and the HelpMate will receive the reward. Additionally, the HelpMate will earn a fair amount based on the post's impressions.

3. If no picture proof is uploaded after the job has been fulfilled by the "HelpMate," the job is considered failed, and no reward will be received.

4. The "HelpMate" is allowed to post a picture of the job that they partially completed or failed to complete with only "#Failed" as a caption. The "HelpMate" will not receive the reward money but will be compensated in some other way.

5. If the captions are not added to the post, the "HelpMate" will not receive any compensation and will also be penalized instead.

(Important Note: The penalty will not be a monetary fine)

A button is provided to activate the HelpMate.

After reading through the rules, Jessie thought to herself that she could make some easy money from this app. It was no wonder it was such a big deal. Although the penalty would not be a fine, maybe just a temporary ban from using the app, it seemed like a low-risk, high-profit opportunity that she couldn't pass up. So, she enabled the "HelpMate." A new option popped up on her newsfeed page called "Jobs," she clicked on that option, and a message appeared that no nearby jobs were currently available but Jessica will be notified when a request comes in. Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

Jessie got startled, and after a moment of silence, she thought it was just her imagination. When the doorbell rang again, she got out of bed, a little scared. The clock showed 11:30, an odd time for anyone to come, especially since the whole town usually became as quiet as a graveyard after 8 o'clock. The doorbell rang again, and Jessie had no option but to check it out. She went to the front door, slowly approached it, and opened it. To her surprise, no one was there, just a card at the doorstep that only read "Welcome." She dismissed it as some kind of prank and went to bed.

## Part 1 (Coffee)

It was a hot but beautiful day, Jessie and her friends were sipping down some coffee while having  fun conversations.
