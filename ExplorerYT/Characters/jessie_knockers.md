Jessie Knockers, a single young adult woman in her late 20s, is on the brink of starting a new chapter in her life in a tranquil town, far removed from major cities, accompanied by her mother. Having lost her father at a young age, Jessie, as a school teacher, is the sole provider for this family of two. However, an unexpected decline in the school's revenue led to staff cuts, and unfortunately, Jessie was among those affected. Faced with this sudden change, she embarked on a frantic job search, applying to all the schools she could find, while her mother explored part-time employment options.

Their fortunes took a turn when a benevolent neighbor, an elderly woman, recommended Jessie to a local school. The elderly woman made a few phone calls, and soon Jessie found herself appointed as a new teacher in the town.

Despite the lack of proximity to major cities and minimal contact with old friends, the allure of a substantial paycheck and a delightful environment prompted Jessie to consider relocating permanently. However, her mother held a different perspective. Fearing an underlying issue, she urged Jessie to seek another job. A heated discussion about differing perceptions of reality ensued between mother and daughter. Eventually, Jessie's mother acquiesced, and they decided to make the move. The sale of their city house yielded a significant sum, allowing them to purchase a house in the town twice the size of their previous residence, it was very cheap compared to the city but it took almost 80% the money they obtained from the sale of their former home.
