# Introduction

It was a typical sunny weekend when 8-year-old Shane shared his plans with his mother, Gloria. "Mom, I'm going out to play," he said. Gloria cautioned Shane to be careful, not to linger around, and to come home early. Shane responded with a simple "Yes, mom," and headed off to play with his friends.

Gloria, a 34-year-old mother, had been divorced from her husband for five years. She discovered his infidelity with another woman, which came as a shock, as she had believed him to be a loving husband. While the separation had left her feeling sad, her job helped her avoid becoming completely devastated. Despite moving on from her ex-husband, her work was creating a growing distance between her and her only son, Shane.

One day, she received a call from her hometown's hospital, informing her that her mother, Samantha, had been admitted and her presence was required. Gloria took Shane with her and returned to her hometown after many years. Thankfully, her mother's condition improved, and she was discharged from the hospital with instructions to rest. Gloria and Shane ended up staying at her mother's house for a few weeks.

Her hometown was distant from bustling cities, a medium-sized town with a moderate population. It featured a forested mountain area on one side and a coastline on the other. The town comprised residential neighborhoods, a few shops, a downtown area, parks, a hospital, bathhouses, farms, a beach, mountain trails, and forests. Gloria had forgotten how stunning and serene her hometown was, and Shane was reluctant to leave, wishing to permanently stay there. His extroverted nature helped him make new friends during their stay.

Samantha was elated to reunite with her daughter and grandson after such a prolonged absence. She was hesitant to see them depart, and Gloria also desired an escape from her own melancholic and frustrated life. Inspired by the idea, Gloria decided to relocate to her hometown and embark on a fresh chapter of life with her son.Thanks to her impeccable professional background, securing a teaching position at the town's sole school was effortless for her. Now, she could see her son every day, even at school.

So, here they were, a months after settling in, and they were loving it. There was a family shop connected to their house that Samantha ran, although it didn't have many customers. However, the revenue it generated and Gloria's salary helped them live decently, even after paying all the bills.

# Chapter 0 (trial room shed)

Gloria went to the shop and offered her assistance to her mother Samantha, but Samantha reassured her not to worry, as she was just getting old and not weak. Instead, Samantha asked Gloria to organize the shed at the back of the house, as it hadn't been looked after for over a year. Gloria agreed and made her way to the shed. Upon opening the door, she was greeted with a dusty and cobweb-filled mess. "It's going to take all day," she said to herself, and began the task of cleaning and organizing.

While sorting through the shed, Gloria stumbled upon her old belongings such as toys, photo albums, clothes, and more. Nostalgia washed over her, filling her with happiness as she looked at her cherished possessions from the past. Curiosity got the best of her, and she decided to try on some of her old clothes. Checking to make sure no one was around, and seeing that the coast was clear, she started trying on her old clothes within the shed.

As anticipated, the clothes no longer fit her. They were much too short and revealed more of her body than she was comfortable with. Additionally, the clothes felt uncomfortably tight. This realization made her reflect on her current wardrobe; she began to wonder if her regular clothes were also becoming too tight and if she might be gaining weight.

Just as she was lost in her thoughts, a voice called out her name—it was her mother, Samantha. Startled, Gloria quickly replied that she was coming and swiftly changed back into her regular clothes. She then headed inside the house to join her mother.

# Chapter 1 (weird old man MR.HUMPER)

Samantha asked Gloria if she could look after the shop for a while, as she was feeling a bit tired and wanted to rest and freshen up. Gloria readily agreed, telling her to take her time. Samantha expressed her gratitude and headed inside the house to relax. After a little while, Gloria was walking around the store, going through the inventory, when suddenly the door opened, and an elderly man in his 70s or 80s walked in.

Gloria warmly greeted the man, and he inquired about the store owner, Samantha. Thinking on her feet, Gloria mentioned that Samantha was currently out, but she was there to assist with any inquiries or purchases he might have. The elderly man went on to ask about her identity, to which Gloria replied that she was Gloria, Samantha's daughter.

The old man scrutinized her from head to toe with a creepy look, causing her to feel uneasy. Trying to shift the focus, she asked him once more if he was interested in making a purchase. Ignoring her question entirely, the old man remarked, "So, you're Samantha's daughter. I've never seen you before. I was a little puzzled about why such a beautiful woman was here to greet me." Gloria found herself taken aback by his comment, not quite knowing how to respond.

Continuing the conversation, the old man inquired whether she was married and had children. This question caught Gloria off guard, leaving her feeling both perplexed and uncomfortable. Despite her hesitation, noticing the old man's seemingly friendly demeanor, she responded that she was indeed married and had a son. He wanted to engage in a conversation about her married life. Uncomfortable with the topic, she attempted to change the subject, but the old man completely disregarded her efforts and proceeded to ask about her age.

Annoyed by the persistent questioning, Gloria curtly stated her age as 34. The old man then launched into a somewhat boastful monologue, "34 and only one offspring? Damn kids these days are weak and lazy. My wife and I had 3-4 offspring, and one was already on its way by the time we were your age. Now we have more than 8 kids. My wife's belly would remain empty only on rare occasions when we were young. You are still young and beautiful; you should have more kids."

As she listened to this conversation, Gloria was both shocked and incredulous, silently questioning, "How is that even possible? More than 8 kids... 3-4 kids at my age? Is that even possible? Are they even human?" She couldn't wrap her head around the idea. She ultimately dismissed the notion, convincing herself that the old man must be joking – he simply had to be. Gathering her courage, she managed to stutter out a question, "How is that even possible?"

The old man responded with a creepy smile, suggesting that if she wanted to find out, she would. This snapped Gloria back to reality, and she exclaimed, "What?!" in disbelief.

The old man quickly changed the subject and inquired about the availability of fertilizers at the shop. Gloria confirmed that there were some in stock, and the old man made a purchase. With a slightly unsettling smile, he bid her farewell with a creepy smile and a phrase "Catch you soon" and left the shop. Gloria was left feeling both puzzled and disturbed by the encounter.

Just as she was processing the strange interaction, Samantha entered the shop and asked Gloria if everything was alright. Gloria shared her experience, explaining that she had a bizarre encounter with an old man who asked strange questions and made peculiar comments. Samantha immediately recognized the description and identified him as Mr. Humper. She mentioned that he visits the store occasionally to buy equipment for his farm, considering him a somewhat regular customer. Samantha reassured Gloria, saying, "Don't worry, he's harmless. He's just a little eccentric."

Gloria felt a sense of relief hearing that Mr. Humper's behavior was not a cause for concern. However, a touch of annoyance crept in as she realized she might have to face such encounters with him from time to time.

# Chapter 1.1 (Shower)

Samantha kindly suggested that Gloria take a break and freshen up, assuring her that the bathroom was ready for use. Gloria promptly accepted the offer, acknowledging that she needed it after the weired encounter with the old man.

# Chapter 2 (Rumor about the school)

Shane and his friends, Julie, Cassey, Brad, and John, were engrossed in play at the children's park when Brad suddenly brought up an intriguing topic. He asked the group if any of them had heard about the ghost that supposedly haunted their school. With a mischievous grin, Shane responded, "A ghost?"

Curious, Julie chimed in, "Is it that ghost people say you can only see if you perform some sort of ritual at the school?" Brad corrected her, mentioning that it wasn't a ritual but a game of hide and seek that revealed the ghost's presence. Intrigued, Shane expressed his skepticism, questioning how someone could play hide and seek with a ghost they couldn't even see.

Brad, however, clarified, "No, not that. Let me tell you the story my grandma shared with me last night." His friends gathered around, eager to hear the tale.

Brad began his story by sharing a surprising fact: his grandmother had attended the same school they were currently studying in. Shane was taken aback and exclaimed, "Seriously? Your grandmother went to this school?" Cassey chimed in, explaining that it was possible considering the school was the only one in town and had been around for a long time. Brad nodded and then resumed his story.

He continued, "So, when my grandma was in school, there was a day when one of her friends invited her to take part in investigating the school's ghost. Naturally, she was curious about what this entailed." Intrigued, the group listened intently.

Brad explained, "Her friend suggested they play a game of hide and seek within the school building at night to try and see the ghost. My grandma was confused by the idea of playing hide and seek to encounter a ghost, but her friend explained that there were certain rules that needed to be followed for this to work." He listed the rules:

All participants must wear the school uniform.
The game area is limited to the school building.
The lights must be completely turned off and cannot be turned on during the game. Candles are the only source of light allowed.
No one is allowed to leave the building during a round.
The more participants, the better (optional).
According to these conditions, they believed they would be able to witness the ghost. Brad mentioned that despite the fact that the school was usually empty at night, and even the security guard didn't remain, they were unable to obtain the keys from the guard. Instead, they made a hole in the boundary wall and sneaked into the school after dark.

Continuing the story, Brad shared, "There were five of them playing that night, having so much fun that they completely forgot about the ghost. As it got late, they decided to play one final round before heading home. My grandma was the 'den'—the person who closes her eyes and counts—so before counting, she decided to make sure all five participants were present. She knew there should be five, but just to confirm, she counted."

He paused for effect, then continued, "But when she finished counting, she was shocked to find that there were six players, not five. She recounted, but the result remained the same—there were six players. Panicked and confused, she exclaimed out loud about the extra person. Her friends also recounted and reached the same unsettling result—six players instead of five. They called out their names, but each time they counted, the number remained six."

Brad's story grew more intense as he described their panic. "Terrified, they all rushed home and didn't return to school for the next few days. All of them fell ill with high fever, but they never told anyone about what had happened."

As Brad concluded his story, his friends were left wide-eyed and intrigued by the eerie tale his grandmother had shared with him. Everyone was a little scared but Shane refused to believe that to be true and said that ghost arn't real, just a thing that adults use to scare us that all. Brad was a little angry and said "If it's not real then ask your mother, she used to study in the school as well, she would confirm that the school is haunted". Shane agreed to ask his mother about it and it was getting late so they all headed home.

# Chapter 2.5 (If Shane ask about the school to Gloria)

At home, Shane, his mother Gloria, and his grandmother Samantha were having dinner together at the dinner table. During the meal, Shane decided to bring up a topic. He turned to his mother and asked if there were any stories about the school, particularly any haunted stories. Gloria thought back and explained that there were indeed a few rumors when she was young, but they were likely just that—rumors. Curious, she inquired what had happened that led Shane to ask about this.

Shane eagerly shared that earlier that day, Brad had told them a story about his grandmother's experience. According to Brad's tale, his grandmother and her friends had played hide and seek at the school one night and encountered a ghost. Gloria couldn't resist having a little fun with Shane and decided to play along. She teasingly said, "Well, Shane, it could be a ghost, or maybe it's a monster disguised as a human, waiting to grab you from BEHIND!" Shane was startled and exclaimed, "Mom!" in response. Gloria, still chuckling, quickly apologized, saying, "I couldn't help myself."

Samantha chimed in, advising Gloria not to tease Shane like that. She pointed out how scared Shane seemed. Shane protested, insisting, "I'm not scared, Grandma." Samantha warmly assured him that she knew he was a brave boy. Gloria playfully countered, "My little boy is not brave at all, mother. He's usually the first to get scared," which prompted laughter. Shane, once again, exclaimed, "Mom!"

Samantha intervened, emphasizing Shane's bravery and reminding Gloria not to undermine it. Gloria, with a laugh, explained that she was simply showing her motherly love in her own way. The lighthearted exchange continued over dinner, creating a warm and jovial atmosphere in their home.

# Chapter 3 (If Shane doesn't ask about the school to Gloria)

At home, Shane, his mother Gloria, and his grandmother Samantha were sharing dinner together at the dinner table. Amidst the meal, Gloria turned to Shane and asked if he had anything to share. Shane responded with a smile, "No, nothing. The food is really good, that's all." Samantha thanked Shane for his kind words, expressing that she had prepared the meal with special care just for him.

During the conversation, Gloria suddenly brought up a more serious topic. She asked, "Am I getting fat?" This unexpected question caused both Samantha and Shane to pause and look at her. Samantha inquired why Gloria was asking such a question. Gloria explained that lately, she had been feeling that her clothes were fitting more tightly. Samantha, with her straightforward manner, replied, "Yes, you are gaining weight."

Hearing this response, Gloria turned to Shane and asked him the same question. After a moment's hesitation, Shane reluctantly echoed, "Yes, you are getting fat, Mom." Unfortunately, Gloria felt a twinge of hurt from his straightforward answer. Samantha, always one to provide guidance, advised Gloria not to wallow in self-pity and to consider incorporating more physical activity. To emphasize the point, Shane also chimed in, agreeing with his grandmother's suggestion.

Feeling a mix of emotions, Gloria conceded, saying, "Fine, I will try to start working out from now on." This decision marked a step toward a healthier routine and a more active lifestyle. The family dinner table had not only provided a meal but also an open space for discussions about well-being and encouragement for positive change.

# Chapter 4 ("Do it" app)

Gloria woke up later than usual, greeted by a beautiful sunny morning. She descended the stairs, dressed minimally, and found the house empty. Calling out for her mother, Samantha, went unanswered. Assuming her mother was at the shop, Gloria made her way there. As she approached the door, she overheard voices inside—a conversation between her mother and another person. Though she recognized Samantha's voice, the other woman's voice was unfamiliar. Curiosity got the best of her, and she leaned toward the door to eavesdrop on their conversation.

Gloria overheard Samantha expressing concerns about the shop's declining revenue. After covering necessary bills, there was barely any money left to save. The other woman attempted to offer solace, suggesting they stay strong. She mentioned Gloria's return from the city and proposed that Gloria could help them, being a teacher at the school. However, Samantha responded that Gloria already paid significant medical bills and assisted in the shop occasionally, making it difficult to ask for more financial help from her.

Listening to their conversation, Gloria felt a pang of empathy for the financial troubles her family was facing. She decided she would do whatever she could to contribute by finding a side hustle to alleviate Samantha's worries. After the other person departed, Gloria entered the shop as if she had just arrived, displaying no awareness of the conversation she had overheard. Samantha jokingly pointed out that Gloria had returned "barely clothed" again, suggesting she go back inside the house to avoid being seen in such a state. Gloria agreed, mentioning that she just wanted to check if her son Shane had gone to school. Samantha confirmed that he had, and Gloria reassured her, saying, "Okay, don't worry, Mom," before heading back into the house.

Samantha was left slightly puzzled by Gloria's response, wondering about its significance.
